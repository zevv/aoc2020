Advent of Code 2020 in Nim.

The puzzles open at 06:00 local time, which is a bit too early for me. I read
the description just after I get up, think a bit while having breakfast and
walking the dog, and code during commute. I usually start with pretty dirty
code to get the stars, and spend some time after that cleaning things up.
